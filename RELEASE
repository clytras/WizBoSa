1 Program info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0
Copyright (c) Wiznet 2012
Developed by Christos Lytras
Developed on Debian GNU/Linux 6.0
Compliled and linked with gcc version 4.4.5 (Debian 4.4.5-8)


1.1 Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program is designed to search files for specific text blocks. It uses a config file for its search option, that allows users and/or administrators (from now on addressed just as admins) to have multiple config files with different definitions to search for. The main goal is to search for PHP, Javascript, Perl bot malicious scripts, but other than that, it can be used as a simple text finder (not regular expressions support yet).

The configuration file supports a structured options block that allows multiple options like what files to search for by using wildcard text expressions list and what to search for by a text list.

The program uses libconfig to read/write configuration files and you can find the options syntax here.


2.1 Configuration file options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wizbosa.keywords

Text list that defines which text blocks to search for.

Example:

wizbosa = {
 keywords = [
  "preg_replace",
  "setcookie(",
  ...
 ];
   
wizbosa.files_filter

Text list with wildcard expressions that defines which files to be searched.

Example:

wizbosa = {
 files_filter = [
  "*.php",
  "*.js",
  ...
 ];
   
wizbosa.search_directory

The directory with the files/subdirectories to be searched.

Example:

wizbosa = {
 search_directory = "*.php";
   
wizbosa.recurse_subdirectories

Flag option which tells to recurse (follow) and search subdirectories contained inside search_directory.

Example:

wizbosa = {
 recurse_subdirectories = true;
   
wizbosa.use_files_filter

Flag option which tells if the program shall use files_filter list to filter filenames or to search all the files.

Example:

wizbosa = {
 use_files_filter = true;
   
wizbosa.ignore_files_over

Text representation of the maximum file size that the program shall open for searching.

Example:

wizbosa = {
 ignore_files_over = "5MB";
